# Getting Started

AlgebraicSolving is a computer algebra package for the Julia programming 
language, maintained by Christian Eder and Mohab Safey El Din.

The features of AlgebraicSolving so far includes algorthms for computing
Gr√∂bner bases over finite fields and for computing real solutions.

## Installation

To use Nemo we require Julia 1.6 or higher. Please see
<https://julialang.org/downloads/> for instructions on
how to obtain julia for your system.

At the Julia prompt simply type

```
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("AlgebraicSolving")
```

## Quick start

Here are some examples of using AlgebraicSolving....
